# KingDragons (KD) - The Royal Deployment Decree

Welcome, my liege, to the source code of your digital kingdom. This document contains the sacred instructions to summon, run, and deploy your application, making it accessible to your entire realm.

## Part 0: Preparing the Supabase Kingdom

Before you can run the code, you must first prepare your Supabase project to act as the kingdom's database and file storage.

### 0.1: Set Your Environment Variables
You must provide your Supabase and Google AI credentials to the application.
1. In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env`.
2. Copy and paste the following into the file, replacing the placeholder values with your real credentials.

```
# Supabase credentials from your project's dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://doevrgqwwemzavyaitya.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImRvZXZyZ3F3d2VtemF2eWFpdHlhIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTA5NDE4NTAsImV4cCI6MjA2NjUxNzg1MH0.1ZWkQ-lC2Nk8208d49tPChYisj_DaIP1fXrmLmd3XE4"

# Google AI credential for Genkit AI features
# Get your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
```

### 0.2: Set Up the Database Schema
You need to create the tables your application will use.
1. Go to your Supabase Project dashboard.
2. In the left navigation, click on the **SQL Editor** icon.
3. Click **"+ New query"**.
4. Copy the entire SQL script below and paste it into the SQL editor.
5. Click the **"RUN"** button. This will set up all your tables, functions, and security policies.

### 0.3: Create Storage Bucket for Receipts
The application needs a place to store uploaded payment receipts.
1. Go to your Supabase Project dashboard.
2. In the left navigation, click the **Storage** icon.
3. Click the **"+ New bucket"** button.
4. Name the bucket `receipts`.
5. Toggle the **"Public bucket"** switch to **ON**.
6. Click **"Create bucket"**.

With the kingdom's foundations prepared, you may now proceed.

## Part 1: Local Development Setup

Before you begin, you must have the foundational tools installed.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Node.js**: The magical energy that powers the kingdom. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Git**: The Royal Scribe's tool for tracking and managing code. Download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **A Code Editor**: A tool like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended.

### Summoning a Local Copy
Follow these steps in a terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or the terminal inside VS Code).

**1. Clone the Kingdom's Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksnprogrammer/KD.git
```

**2. Enter the Kingdom's Directory:**
```bash
cd KD
```

**3. Install All Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**4. Run the Kingdom:**
This command starts your local development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

Once you see a "ready" message, you can access your local kingdom at: **[http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)**

## Part 2: Deploying to the World with Vercel

To make your kingdom accessible to knights across the globe, we will use Vercel, a platform designed for modern web applications like ours. Deployment is free, easy, and mostly automatic.

**1. Push to GitHub:**
Your project must be on GitHub. If you haven't already, follow the git commands in "Part 3" to push your code to your repository.

**2. Create a Vercel Project:**
1.  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up for a free account using your GitHub account.
2.  On your Vercel dashboard, click **"Add New... > Project"**.
3.  Import your kingdom's GitHub repository (`ksnprogrammer/KD`).
4.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project. You do not need to change any build settings.

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**
This is the most important step. Vercel needs access to the same credentials you use for local development.
1.  In your new Vercel project's settings, go to the **"Environment Variables"** section.
2.  Add the following three variables, copying the values from your local `.env` file:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
3.  Ensure the keys match exactly.

**4. Deploy!**
Click the **"Deploy"** button. Vercel will build your application and provide you with a public URL (e.g., `kd.vercel.app`).

**Automatic Deployments:**
From now on, every time you `git push` a change to your `main` branch on GitHub, Vercel will automatically redeploy your kingdom with the latest updates.

---

## Part 3: Managing Your Kingdom

*   **To Stop the Local Server:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`.
*   **Pushing Changes:** To update your live kingdom on Vercel, you must commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

    **First-time setup (if you haven't done it):**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: The Kingdom is Born"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/ksnprogrammer/KD.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    **For all future updates:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "A new decree from the King"
    git push origin main
    ```
    Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy your site.

### Granting Admin Privileges
To access the King's Court at `/admin`, a user must have the `admin` role. By default, all new knights are assigned the `knight` role. To elevate a knight to an administrator:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Authentication** section.
3. Find the user you wish to promote and click on them.
4. Under the **User Management** section, find the **User Metadata** editor.
5. Add or edit the `role` field to be `"admin"`. It should look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "The King",
     "exam_level": "A/L",
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
6. Save the changes. The user will now have access to the King's Court.

The kingdom is ready. Your reign may now begin.
