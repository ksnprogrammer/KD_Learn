## AI Features Deep Dive

The `src/ai/flows` directory houses the core AI functionalities:

*   `create-module-from-description.ts`: Forges "Knowledge Dragons" (educational modules). It takes a topic description and exam level, then generates a lesson outline, quiz questions, resource suggestions, and an accompanying image.
*   `create-story-flow.ts`: Weaves epic tales based on a user prompt, generating a story title, the full story text, and a relevant image.
*   `generate-audio-flow.ts`: Converts text into speech, providing audio output for various content.
*   `generate-daily-challenge.ts`: Creates unique daily challenges for knights, including a problem description and a reward.
*   `generate-kingdom-report.ts`: Acts as the Royal Scribe, generating reports on content submission statistics and offering strategic advice. It uses a Genkit tool to fetch data from Supabase.
*   `generate-team-war-report.ts`: Generates dynamic reports for the "Team Wars" feature, including live battle updates and historical battle outcomes.
*   `grade-daily-challenge.ts`: Grades a knight's answer to a daily challenge, providing feedback and indicating correctness.

## Part 0: Preparing the Supabase Kingdom

Before you can deploy or run the code, you must first prepare your Supabase project to act as the kingdom's database and file storage.

### 0.1: Get Your Credentials
You will need three keys to run the application:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (From your Supabase Project's API Settings)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (From your Supabase Project's API Settings)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (From [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_URL` (Optional: The full URL to your WhatsApp channel)

Keep these safe and ready for the deployment step.

### 0.2: Set Up the Database Schema
You need to create the tables your application will use.
1. Go to your Supabase Project dashboard.
2. In the left navigation, click on the **SQL Editor** icon.
3. Click **"+ New query"**.
4. Open the `setup.sql` file in this repository, copy its entire contents, and paste it into the Supabase SQL editor.
5. Click the **"RUN"** button. This will set up all your tables, functions, and security policies.

### 0.3: Create Storage Bucket for Receipts
The application needs a place to store uploaded payment receipts.
1. Go to your Supabase Project dashboard.
2. In the left navigation, click the **Storage** icon.
3. Click the **"+ New bucket"** button.
4. Name the bucket `receipts`.
5. Toggle the **"Public bucket"** switch to **ON**.
6. Click **"Create bucket"**.

With the kingdom's foundations prepared, you may now proceed.

## Part 2: Local Development Setup (For Wizards)

If you wish to modify the kingdom's source code, you'll need a local setup.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Node.js**: The magical energy that powers the kingdom. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Git**: The Royal Scribe's tool for tracking and managing code. Download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **A Code Editor**: A tool like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended.

### Summoning a Local Copy
1.  **Set Your Environment Variables:** In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env` and add your credentials.
    ```
    # Supabase credentials from your project's dashboard
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

    # Google AI credential for Genkit AI features
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

    # (Optional) Full URL to your WhatsApp channel for the "Join" buttons
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_URL="YOUR_WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_URL"
    ```
2.  **Install All Dependencies:** Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Kingdom:** This command starts your local development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
Once you see a "ready" message, you can access your local kingdom at: **[http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)**

## Part 3: Managing Your Kingdom

### Granting Admin Privileges
To access the King's Court at `/admin`, a user must have the `admin` role.
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Authentication** section.
3. Find the user you wish to promote and click on them.
4. Under the **User Management** section, find the **User Metadata** editor.
5. Add or edit the `role` field to be `"admin"`. It should look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "The King",
     "exam_level": "A/L",
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
6. Save the changes. The user will now have access to the King's Court.
